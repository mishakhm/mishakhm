# My Projects
## Hue
A social media platform / e-commerce app that helps users research and discover products through short-form video and transparent product ratings.

I built this app with my team in React Native, with a Firebase database. We won top prize LavaLab's Fall 2022 Demo Night!

Here's our minimum viable product so far. It allows users to browse products and videos, upload their own video reviews, interact with reviews, and add new products to our database.

## USC Easy Scheduler
A fully featured class scheduling web app Chrome extension that allows students to interface with USC class registration system in a significantly easier and more powerful way.

I independently designed and then built application flow, functionality, layout, and interface from scratch.
